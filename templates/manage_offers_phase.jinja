## PRICING REFERENCE (per unit)
| Asset | Base Price |
|-------|------------|
| Apple | $5         |
| Chip  | $50        |
| Gold  | $200       |

## CRITICAL: HOW TO SET PRICES
The `price` parameter is the **TOTAL price for ALL units**, NOT per-unit!

**Examples:**
- Sell 10 apples at $5 each → `create_public_offer("apple", 10, 50, "...")`
- Sell 5 chips at $60 each → `create_public_offer("chip", 5, 300, "...")`
- Buy 2 gold at $180 each → `create_buy_offer("gold", 2, 360, "...")`

**Formula:** total_price = quantity × price_per_unit

## BUY OFFER CASH RESERVATION WARNING
When you create a buy offer, the TOTAL PRICE is **IMMEDIATELY DEDUCTED** from your available cash and **LOCKED** until:
- Someone accepts your offer (you get the items), OR
- You cancel the offer (cash is returned)

**DANGER:** If you lock too much cash in buy offers, you may not have enough to pay your **${{ operational_cost }}** operational cost, leading to **BANKRUPTCY → DEATH**. Always keep enough free cash for at least a few rounds of operational costs!
